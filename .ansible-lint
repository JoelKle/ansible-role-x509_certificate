# At the moment any skip_list entry causes ansible-lint to return 0,
# that means it gives for all other errors false negatives.
# See https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/issues/1102
# Workaround for now would be not use skip_list, but individual noqa statements

#skip_list:
#  # 106: Role name TEMPLATE does not match ``^[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`` pattern
#  # role is only a TEMPLATE role, not used per se
#  - '106'
#  # 701: meta/main.yml should contain relevant info
#  - '701'
